Welcome

This is the documentation and demo of the Scriptme.MarkdownContent package for TYPO3 Flow. This will explain what this package does and how it can be used.

I developed this for my personal needs. You are free to use it or fork it and adopt it to your personal needs. I'm happy if you would send back your changes if they are useful for everybody. But please don't expect that I integrate anything. Right now, this is not supposed to be an all purpose solution that handles everything. :-)
